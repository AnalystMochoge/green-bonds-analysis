# Green Bonds Data Analysis ðŸŒ±ðŸ’°
This project focuses on analyzing the Green Bonds dataset to uncover key trends and insights in the world of climate finance. Through data cleaning and visualization using Python, we provide a comprehensive overview of green bond issuance trends, top countries involved, and currency distribution.

### Project Overview
The dataset used in this project contains information on green bond issuance across multiple countries and currencies. The primary objective was to clean the data, visualize key patterns, and extract actionable insights.

### Key Steps:
Data Cleaning:

* Handled missing values and removed unnecessary columns.
* Reformatted data types for consistency.
* Filtered out irrelevant entries (e.g., unknown currencies).
### Visualization:

* Plotted issuance trends over time.
* Highlighted top 10 countries by issuance.
* Created a pie chart showing currency distribution (excluding unknowns).

### Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas (Data Cleaning)
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Markdown
